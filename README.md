A modal (also called a modal window or lightbox) is a web page element that displays in front of and deactivates all other page content. 
To return to the main content, the user must engage with the modal by completing an action or by closing it. 
Modals are often used to direct usersâ€™ attention to an important action or piece of information on a website or application.
